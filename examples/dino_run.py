# view moves instantly in x so as to keep dino in the center
# right arrow sets dino acceleration while pressed
  # there is low maximum speed and much ground friction
# up arrow sets dino velocity upward if dino is on ground
# gravity pulls dino towards the ground
# on collision dino<->cactus, exit
# the cacti exist in an infinite, deterministic random pattern
